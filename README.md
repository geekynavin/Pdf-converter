## 🌐 Live Demo

🔗 [Visit QRCodeX](https://pdfx-navin.onrender.com/)
## Kindly allow 30–40 seconds for the site to load.
## The project is hosted on Render's free tier, which means the server goes into hibernation when not in use. The first request after inactivity wakes it up, causing a delay of 30–40 seconds.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User selects an image file using the upload form.
2. Django handles the upload, converts the image to PDF using Pillow or reportlab.
3. The converted PDF file is sent back to the browser and downloaded automatically.
